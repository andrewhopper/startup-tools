# Common topics?

## Prompt engineering or fine tuning?

New models are coming out nearly daily.  By the time you figure how how to find tune a new model will be released with better performance.  Focus on prompt engineering.

## k8?

No, don't use Kubernetes unless you have a business requirement for it.
